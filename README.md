# Infosec Journal 🧠🔐

Welcome to my infosec journal—a growing collection of personal notes, CTF writeups, troubleshooting hacks, and tech tips I've picked up along the way. Whether it's weekend capture-the-flag challenges or random issues solved at 1AM, this repo is where I document it all.

## 📂 Structure

/ctf-writeups/ # CTF walkthroughs organized by event and category
/troubleshooting/ # Practical fixes and workarounds from daily tech use
/tools-notes/ # Cheat sheets and usage notes for common security tools

## 🚧 Why this exists

- To track my own learning journey.
- To help others who might be Googling the same weird error.
- To stay sharp through writing and reflection.

If any of this helps you too, awesome. If not, it still helped me get better.
