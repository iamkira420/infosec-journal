# 🛡️ Security Summit 2025 – Blue Team CTF Writeup

This folder contains my full report for the **Blue Team Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenge at the **2025 Security Summit Hackathon**, hosted by ITWeb.

Unlike the extended 28-day format of the Ideathon, this challenge was completed under real-time pressure — within a focused 28-hour window — simulating what it’s like to detect, investigate, 
and respond to active threats in a fast-paced SOC environment.
