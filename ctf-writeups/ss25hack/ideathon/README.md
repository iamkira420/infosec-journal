# 🧠 ITWeb Security Summit Ideathon 2025 – Blue Team CTF Threat Analysis Reports

This folder contains my complete technical submissions for the **ITWeb Security Summit Ideathon 2025**, hosted in collaboration with **Geekulcha** and  **Snode Technologies**. 
The exercises focused on building practical threat detection and analysis skills using real-world tools and frameworks like Wireshark, VirusTotal, and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

## 📁 What's Inside

The combined PDF includes writeups for all three core exercises:

### 1. **Network Traffic Analysis**
- Analyzed a PCAP file using Wireshark  
- Identified and investigated suspicious traffic  
- Correlated IP behavior with threat intelligence platforms (e.g., VirusTotal)  
- Provided security recommendations to mitigate similar threats

### 2. **IOC Correlation and Malware Analysis**
- Investigated a given SHA256 hash linked to Play ransomware  
- Mapped threat behavior across multiple threat intel platforms (AnyRun, SOCRadar, Hybrid Analysis, etc.)  
- Outlined risks, malware behavior, and prevention strategies

### 3. **TTP Mapping (MITRE ATT&CK)**
- Mapped the Play ransomware gang’s tactics, techniques, and procedures  
- Structured findings in line with the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Included recommended mitigations for each tactic category
