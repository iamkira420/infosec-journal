# ðŸ§° Tools Notes

Quick references, tips, and cheat sheets for infosec tools I use regularly. These arenâ€™t full tutorialsâ€”just things I want to remember or refer to quickly.

### Topics Iâ€™ll cover here include:

- Nmap basics and useful flags
- Burp Suite tricks
- Wireshark filters
- Netcat one-liners
- Daily Linux tips
- And more...

As I explore more tools, this section will grow.
