# How I Bulk-Unliked My Liked Songs on Spotify Without Breaking It

> *One of those small but satisfying aha moments.*

## The Problem  
I had **790 songs** in my Spotify **Liked Songs** playlist. I wanted to remove them all—but when I tried the usual:

- `Ctrl + A` to select all  
- Right-click → **Remove from your Liked Songs**

I kept getting a frustrating **“Something went wrong”** error. No matter how many times I tried, Spotify just couldn’t handle it.

## The Fix (Aha Moment)  
Turns out, Spotify auto-tags your liked songs with genres and vibes like:

- `rap`  
- `beats`  
- `rnb`  
- `tempo`  
- `soul`  

These tags show up at the top of the Liked Songs playlist.

### 🔧 So here’s what worked:

1. **Click on one of the tags** (e.g., `rap`) — this filters the playlist.
2. Press `Ctrl + A` — this selects only the **visible** songs under that tag.
3. Right-click → **Remove from your Liked Songs**
4. Repeat for each tag until the playlist is cleared.

**⚠️ Tip:**  
Start with the tags that have **more songs** first. As you reduce your Liked Songs count, Spotify **removes those tag filters**, so clearing the bigger batches early helps avoid issues later. Once the tags disappear, you may need to delete songs manually or in smaller chunks using `Shift + Click`.

## Final Thoughts  
Sometimes the best solutions aren’t about brute force, but about *filtering smarter*. Feels good to troubleshoot and outsmart even small tech annoyances like this.
